 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>...Those words make me sick.
By luck, no, by horrible luck, I was blessed by the holy blade and forced onto the path of killing the demon lord.
I had everyone's attention on me, and their hopes became the sole reason for me to push ahead...
With the weight of the world on my shoulders, I pressed on, never resting.

<p/>What was the reward for my deeds?
To be idolised?
To be an inspiration?
I didn't want any of it.

<p/>Another man could say, your reward is your adventure and the memories of your companions.
Don't make me laugh.
Memories of your companions?
Let me say it again,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heroes exist to save the world, not to save their companions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>The fate of my companions was always destined to be a cruel one.
In order to defeat the demon lord who would destroy the world.
Whether it was before or after he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) rose up in power.
Of course, as a hero, as an individual, I tried my utmost to save those who were important to me.
But the results had always been disastrous.
The pain I felt as they whispered to me with their dying breaths,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At least you managed to make it out alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>The path of a hero is filled with more sorrow than happiness.
I could not fail to live up to their expectations.
Even when I wandered on the borders of insanity, the people would put their hopes on my existance.
Those days would continue as I fought on with blood in my mouth.
Heroes may exist to save the world,
but I fought for the eternal peace of death.
I'd had enough of this life.

<p/>The mysterious monsters who would invade our homes.
The villains who dared to harm my friends.
I had slain many,
and saved the lives of many more from the jaws of death.
And in the end...
I managed to slay the demon lord.

<p/>***

<p/>How high up was it?
The clouds were laid out below him (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) fell from the skies together with a giant.
With red skin and a giant horn.
The demon lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kuuuh...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Countless wounds were visible on his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) colossal body.
He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) gritted his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) teeth and stared at his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) foe, struggling to retain consciousness.
In his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) foe's right hand, the holy sword shone brightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``...''

 (<font color='red'><b>foe</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) foe was standing on top of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) forehead. The hero who slayed the demon lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is going through your mind right now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>demon</b></font>)</div><p/>The demon lord asked the hero.
Although he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) felt nothing but fury towards him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had no choice but to acknowledge his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) power.
So he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) foe, his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) equal, out of curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you're asking for my thoughts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The hero</b></font>)</div><p/>The hero spoke.
His (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) face seemed somewhat pale as he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) fell towards certain death.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``...''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After a small pause, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) replied quietly,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The demon lord could not understand his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) answer,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The demon lord</b></font>)</div><p/>`Yes, this is enough right?'

<p/>That was what he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) truly thought.
Why?

<p/>`If it's not you, if you're not here, if you can't...'

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)'s heard it a million times.

<p/>`Only you can do it.'
`It's impossible unless it's you.'
`Only you can save them.'
`You must protect them.'

<p/>To act as the symbol of their hope, to live up to their wishes.
It had taken its toll on him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm just really tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was so hard to meet those gazes that were trying to hold onto what little faith they had.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Honestly, I don't want it anymore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) remembered all the lines about heroes that had been said to him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) looked down. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was falling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``...''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) fell from the insane height, his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) clothes fluttered uncontrollably.
The stars shone at the edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) vision, and the cold winds swiped at him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>).

<p/>`Finally...'

<p/>It was difficult to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) eyes open, so he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) half-closed them.
The clouds that had been far below him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) now caressed his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) body.
The ground was getting closer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``...I'm almost there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The hero</b></font>)</div><p/>The hero could see the ashen black buildings made of concrete.
Every time he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) blinked, they were closer. It was moments before the final impact.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aaah, this is the end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the hero</b></font>)</div><p/>At this height, even the hero could not avoid instant death.
He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) would become unrecognisable.
With all the injuries and curses on him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>), resurrection was also impossible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``...?''

 (<font color='red'><b>demon</b></font>)</div><p/>The demon lord tilted his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) head in curiosity.
Even after saving the world, after so much sacrifice, only death awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>). Yet the hero was smiling.
As if, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) greatest peace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Huh? Those two are falling!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was almost there.
Through the people's shouting, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) heard the demon lord's head hit the ground, making a sound like a tomato being crushed.
And it was his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) turn soon after.
And so...
The hero fell.

<p/>***

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The successor?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In the famed Iphelleta House.''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>In the crowded inn, people were talking of the rumors about the selection of the Iphelleta House's new successor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Finn</b></font>)</div><p/>The Finn Iphelleta House, which was famous for its swordsmanship, had three sons.
The first, Ryan the Geuk-Geom, famous for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ryan</b></font>) strength.
The second, Lloyd the Sok-Geom, famous for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) speed.
The third, however...
TLN: Geuk-Geom = Strong Blade, Sok-Geom = Quick Blade

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The successor will be one of those three sons!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Quick</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only one of them will be chosen right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't it be Ryan, the eldest?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, who knows? I heard that the second-born, Lloyd, is quite sharp too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I thought they were blessed to have three sons, but having so many has its troubles, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's a problem for all high-class families, especially such high nobles.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``For us peasants, sons are always better!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who knows, you might win something big if you have a beautiful daughter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hahaha! With your face? Dream on, brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Finn</b></font>)</div><p/>Iffa village, a territory ruled by the Finn Iphelleta House. The inn was full of speculations about the new successor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From the sounds of things, it's either going to be the first or the second, is that right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, thats true.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What about the third?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well, apparently he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is completely useless.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was born that way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``...''

 (<font color='red'><b>A butler</b></font>)</div><p/>A certain butler, who looked out of place in this inn, tightened his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) grip on his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) beer, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) was trying to shatter the glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s a noble and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s known as the `Lazy'. In a way, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s more famous than the other two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The Third.
Famous within the Iphelleta House for his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) awe inspiring laziness.
Titled, Na-Geom.
Riley.
TLN: Na-Geom = Lazy Sword

<p/><div class="bookquote">``...Na-Geom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hah! Never heard of such disgrace in my life.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know how the Iphelleta House is famous for its swordsmanship? Well apparently, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s never swung a damn sword in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) life...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Basically, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s beyond hopeless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The others</b></font>)</div><p/>The others nodded in agreement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, what's the reason for it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I heard he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) gets a seizure when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) does.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nah, I heard he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s got some allergy to it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Apparently he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s more of a vegetable and can't even move. I heard he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) just lies on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) bed all day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``...!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man who had been listening suddenly stood up, furious. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was as red as an apple.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You fucking sons of bit-...!''
