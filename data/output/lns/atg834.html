<p/>Before Jasmine left, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jasmine</b></font>) deliberately chose not to deal with the people who posed the greatest threat to Yun Che... especially Xuanyuan Wentian and Ye Meixie, both of whom had extremely great enmity towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Meixie</b></font>). The most important reason behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Jasmine</b></font>) leaving them alive was her (<font color='blue'><b>Jasmine</b></font>) belief that Yun Che would definitely not fall into their hands, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) was still not capable of facing them.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jasmine</b></font>) knew very well what kind of personality Yun Che had and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jasmine</b></font>) also knew all of the trump cards he (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) hands, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jasmine</b></font>) was convinced of this point.

<p/>Yun Che only needed to borrow the power of the Primordial Profound Ark to return to the Illusory Demon Realm first and avoid the Four Sacred Grounds. Given his (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) innate talent, surpassing the Four Sacred Masters was only a matter of time. Furthermore, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) was not even able to wait for that short period of ten or so years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) could just practice dual cultivation with Feng Xue'er, borrowing the power of Feng Xue'er's Phoenix vital yin, his (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) power would explosively grow within a short period of time and it would grow so explosively that even Jasmine was not able to predict where it would end.

<p/>At the same time, Feng Xue'er would also receive the benefits of his (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) Dragon God bloodline, which would be an enormous boon in awakening her (<font color='blue'><b>Jasmine</b></font>) Phoenix Soul. At that time, if the two of them combined their powers and if the Little Demon Empress joined in as well, there would be nothing in either the Profound Sky Continent or Illusory Demon Realm that would be able to threaten them.

<p/>So, she (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) spared the Four Sacred Grounds, whom Yun Che could not currently go up against, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) to deal with them himself. Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) was not the least bit worried about his (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) situation at all.

<p/>But things had changed to the point where it completely deviated from what she (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) had anticipated.

<p/>Furthermore, it was not a power from the Profound Sky Continent who had created this drastic change, it was Moonflower herself!

<p/>This finally resulted in Yun Che facing the most dangerous situation he (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) had ever experienced in both his (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) lives barely an hour after she (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) had resolutely left.

<p/>After feeling Xuanyuan Wentian's aura abruptly latch on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) own, Feng Xue'er's heart, which had been in a constant state of panic and fear, instantly descended into an icy abyss. She (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) grabbed on tightly to the blood-soaked Yun Che. All of the Phoenix flames surrounding her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) body started to burn even more vigorously as she (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) desperately utilized all of her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) power to flee westwards at her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) fastest possible speed.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) innate talent was matchless and she (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) had already arrived at the peak of the Profound Sky Continent even before her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) powers had fully awakened. But the person who was chasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) just had to be Xuanyuan Wentian! Even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) was desperately using her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) full power to flee, she (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) could feel that dreadful aura creeping closer and closer. The power that had latched onto her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) body also kept growing colder and heavier.

<p/>After turning around, she (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) could see a blurry black dot rapidly growing bigger in her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) vision zooming in from the distant horizon.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) glance at Yun Che, who was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) arms, as the fear in her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) eyes slowly melted into heartbreaking sadness and gentleness... When they had been on the Primordial Profound Ark all those years ago, Yun Che had desperately fled while holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) arms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) was originally completely uninvolved in the entire matter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) could even have preserved his (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) own life by handing her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) over to Ye Xinghan. Furthermore, it was likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Xinghan</b></font>) would have gained some <div class="bookquote">``benefits''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>from doing so. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Xinghan</b></font>) had not and the arm that was tightly wound around her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) did not relax in the slightest... Even when Ye Xinghan was hot on their heels.

<p/>It was at that moment that his (<font color='blue'><b>Xinghan</b></font>) name and figure were deeply engraved in the deepest parts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) soul.

<p/>Feng Xue'er's speed began to slow because she (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) knew that if it was Xuanyuan Wentian who was chasing them, any further attempt to flee would be meaningless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Big Brother Yun, Xue'er does not have the strength to protect you but... don't worry Big Brother Yun, no matter where you go, I will... forever be by your side...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Feng</b></font>)</div><p/>After saying those words, all the fear in Feng Xue'er's heart suddenly disappeared as she (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) slowed down... As she (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) was prepared to turn around and clash with Xuanyuan Wentian, a figure suddenly appeared like a ghost in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>). This person was wreathed in an aura that was incomparably sinister and cold.

<p/>Feng Xue'er gave a small gasp as she (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>) ground to a complete halt and dazedly stared at the person who had suddenly appeared in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Empress</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``You...''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) was all dressed in black, his (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) half-opened eyes glowed with a black light and one could barely even see any white left in his (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) eyes. There was even a layer of pitch-black mist that surrounding him (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) and a pitch-black greatsword, the Heavenly Sin Divine Sword, was slung across his (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) back!

<p/>This person was astonishingly Fen Juechen!

<p/>The devil blood in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) body had awakened and his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) power had grown explosively in the past few weeks. Today he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had come to Divine Phoenix City to use his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) greatly increased strength to kill someone he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had desired to kill... and the person he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) desired to kill the most was naturally Xuanyuan Wentian!

<p/>Because he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was the chief mastermind of the plot that had destroyed the Eternal Night Royal Family one thousand years ago!

<p/>Fen Juechen also believed that Xuanyuan Wentian would definitely attend the engagement banquet of Yun Che and Feng Xue'er.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) was not clear as to the limits of Xuanyuan Wentian's strength but his (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) greatly increased strength had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) much confidence. Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) could not contain the desire to immediately vent the deep resentment and hatred that lay in the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) soul. But the first person he (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) had met when he (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) had arrived at the Divine Phoenix City was Yun Che. Even though the two of them were not in agreement with each other and Yun Che's words had even caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) to go into a rage, those words had indeed splashed a bucket of cold water on his (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) agitated brain, causing him (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) to regain some clear-headedness.

<p/>As the heroes of the realm gathered to attend the engagement banquet, Fen Juechen brooded outside the gate of Phoenix City. After a long while, he (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) finally managed to choose self-control and turned around to leave. Yun Che's words had indeed reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) devil blood had just awakened and there was still a lot of room for growth. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) lost because of a moment of impulse, then everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) had endured would have been for nothing.

<p/>After that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) left Divine Phoenix City.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) had never thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) would actually meet Feng Xue'er and Yun Che in this place... with one Xuanyuan Wentian hot on their heels!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Yun</b></font>)'s dead!?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fen Juechen</b></font>)</div>Fen Juechen coldly said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) stared at the blood-soaked Yun Che who did not even have a trace of life left.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't spout nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Right now, the word <div class="bookquote">``dead''  (<font color='red'><b>Feng</b></font>)</div>assaulted Feng Xue'er's weak mental state. She (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) vigorously shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) head as she (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Big Brother Yun won't die... Big Brother Yun won't die so easily!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``...''  (<font color='red'><b>Feng</b></font>)</div>The black light in Feng Juechen's eyes trembled as Xiao Lingxi's soft but resolute voice echoed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) mind...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``...The reason why I did not accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Yun</b></font>) all those years ago was because I could not leave my father to languish by himself. Right now, Father has Xiao Yun... So if anything happens to Little Che, I will definitely go accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) right away, I definitely won't allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) to stay in the other world by himself...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Xiao</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ssss...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Fen Juechen's mouth twisted faintly as the black energy around his (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) body began moving agitatedly as if it was mist that was being blown around by a strong wind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since he (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) isn't dead... then why aren't you getting him (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) away from here right away!?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fen Juechen</b></font>)</div>With an abrupt roar, Fen Juechen fully opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) eyes and stared at the black shadow that was swiftly closing in from behind Feng Xue'er. He (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) gritted his (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) teeth firmly before snarling out a name in a voice that was so cold that it penetrated bone, <div class="bookquote">``Xuan... yuan... Wen... tian!!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>BOOOOM!!

<p/>Amidst the violent explosions of cold and sinister energy, Fen Juechen shot forward like a black bolt of lightning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) swept past Feng Xue'er, radiating a heaven-shaking aura of malevolence and killing intent as he (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) rushed towards Xuanyuan Wentian. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) rushed forward, Fen Juechen let out a roar that was filled with boundless hatred and resentment, <div class="bookquote">``Xuanyuan Wentian, hand over your life!!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fen Juechen</b></font>)</div><p/>Feng Xue'er stood there completely dazed for a moment.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) suddenly met Fen Juechen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) had felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) heart sinking. Compared to Xuanyuan Wentian, Fen Juechen was the person who most wanted to kill Yun Che in this world and this occasion was the perfect opportunity for him (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) to do so.

<p/>However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) not only did not make any moves to take advantage of the situation, instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>)... rushed towards Xuanyuan Wentian who had been hot on her (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) heels.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) had personally seen and felt the dreadfully dense and intense hatred and killing intent Fen Juechen had towards Yun Che. But right now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Che</b></font>) was actually doing something that completely contradicted that!?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) did not turn back as she (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) once again pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) speed to the limit, fleeing into the unknown distance. In the blink of an eye, she (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) felt the energy that was locking onto her (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) disappear and she (<font color='blue'><b>Feng</b></font>) also felt Xuanyuan Wentian's aura grow further and further away.

<p/>BOOOOOOM!!!!

<p/>A curtain of black light abruptly spread across the sky, causing all the light in the surrounding area to grow dimmer by several degrees. At the same time, an invisible sword beam seemed to descend from the heavens as it instantly cut this curtain of black light in half, severing the mountain below it into two equal halves as well.

<p/>BOOM BOOM BOOM...

<p/>The black clouds which covered the sky began to roil and rumble as if indicating that a storm was imminent. Beneath the curtain of black light that had been slashed in half, Xuanyuan Wentian and Fen Juechen's gazes clashed with one another. Xuanyuan Wentian had initially been been thrown off balance but once he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could clearly see Fen Juechen, his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyes suddenly narrowed as the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mouth hooked up into a strange and unfathomable smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are not more than ten people in the entire Profound Sky Continent that can display this level of power. I had originally thought that one of those ten people had intentionally come to spoil my plans but I never thought that it would actually be... Tsk, tsk.''  (<font color='red'><b>Xuanyuan Wentian</b></font>)</div>Xuanyuan Wentian crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) arms across his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) chest as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) measured Fen Juechen with his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyes. His (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) gaze lingered especially long on the Heavenly Sin Divine Sword that was slung across Fen Juechen's back as his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) smile grew even more strange.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) calm and unruffled appearance clearly showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was not in a rush to chase after Feng Xue'er who was fleeing further and further away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Xuanyuan Wentian! Today is... the day that you die!!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fen Juechen</b></font>)</div>Fen Juechen was like a lone wolf who was facing down his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) mortal enemy. He (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) stretched out a hand and slowly grasped the Heavenly Sin Divine Sword that was strapped across his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) back. In an instant, ten bolts of black lightning split the air around him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>). Black light curled around the body of the jet-black sword as an incomparably dreadful, sinister and cold aura pervaded the area.

<p/>It was fortunate that this was a desolate and uncivilized area and not a city. Otherwise the entire city would have been shrouded with this dark might.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Xuanyuan Wentian</b></font>)</div>Xuanyuan Wentian was still smiling merrily, he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) did not assume a fighting stance, <div class="bookquote">``Are you not going to explain why you want to kill this sword master?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you get to hell, you can ask King Yama yourself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The black light in Fen Juechen's eyes flashed as a beam of black light shot out from the Heavenly Sin Divine Sword and exploded towards Xuanyuan Wentian.

<p/>This sword stroke did not have any wind up nor did it require any accumulation of energy but it carried the full brunt of Fen Juechen's boundless hate and killing intent. Furthermore, even though this looked like an incredibly casual and common sword stroke, the moment it was unleashed, the air around him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) was instantly compressed as an enormous darkness energy crazily converged from all directions. In an instant, a huge vortex of darkness energy had formed at the tip of the Heavenly Sin Divine Sword.

<p/>Xuanyuan Wentian's originally casual and relaxed expression froze up abruptly as he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) suddenly felt as if his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) body had become mired in mud. Following that, an unbearable sensation that grew heavier by the moment began pressing down on him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) could faintly hear the wails and mutterings of countless evil spirits and ghosts whispering in his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) ears. He (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) was slightly dazzled as an asura purgatory that was strewn with bodies and mountains of corpses appeared in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>)... he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) could even smell the scent of blood that was so thick that it assailed his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) nostrils.

<p/>Xuanyuan Wentian had two thousand years of cultivation and he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) had a wealth of experiences and knowledge. So he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) instantly realized that the other party's aura of darkness had actually affected his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) very heart and soul!

<p/>To be more accurate, it had created a sort of suppressive effect on his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) soul!

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) had met Fen Juechen the last time, he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) had been absolutely shocked by the rate at which his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) power grew. What caused him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) to be even more shocked right now was that he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) realized that what had been displayed before was not the full extent of Fen Juechen's power... But this sword stroke was still able to directly suppress his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) soul.

<p/>This clearly meant that Fen Juechen's current might had already begun to approach the level he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) was at!!

<p/>Amidst his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) utter astonishment, Xuanyuan Wentian instantly discarded any carelessness that he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) previously possessed and stopped underestimating this enemy. All of the profound energy in his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) body began to surge unreservedly as countless incorporeal energy swords appeared and formed into a gigantic sword formation.

<p/>Zzt zzt zzzt zzt zzzt zzt....

<p/>Space was mercilessly torn apart as Heaven's Might sword energy shot into that vortex of darkness. The tearing sounds were not ear-piercing, instead it sounded like the sinister and dreadful howls and wails of ghosts and devils.

<p/>Fen Juechen's eyes widened even further as the whites of his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) eyes completely disappeared and all of the darkness energy in his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) body immediately began to surge like a tidal wave. A dreadful energy that was so terrifying that it could not be described poured down on Xuanyuan Wentian in torrents.

<p/>The huge Heaven's Might Sword Formation seemed to be frozen solid as it instantly stopped moving. Xuanyuan Wentian's expression was unexpectedly startled as well... This was no ordinary Heaven's Might Sword Formation, it had been set up by him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>), Xuanyuan Wentian! The only people in the Profound Sky Continent who could directly resist this sword formation were Huangji Wuyu, Qu Fengyi, and Ye Meixie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Meixie</b></font>) had never ever dreamed that Fen Juechen would not only not be routed by the sword formation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Meixie</b></font>) had set up with nearly all his (<font color='blue'><b>Meixie</b></font>) strength, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Meixie</b></font>) was actually able to make Xuanyuan Wentian feel as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Meixie</b></font>) himself was being suppressed.

<p/>However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Meixie</b></font>) did not panic in the slightest. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Meixie</b></font>) had recovered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Meixie</b></font>) shock, the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>Meixie</b></font>) eyes astonishingly lit up with a burning ecstasy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven's Might Absolute Sword... Sky Break!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Ding!!!

<p/>A sword beam that was several kilometers long slashed across the dark and overcast sky, as if it was cutting apart the blue dome of heaven. Under the might of this heaven-shaking sword beam, Xuanyuan Wentian's sword formation and Fen Juechen's vortex of darkness collapsed at the same time as both of the attacks disintegrated into a jumbled mess of profound energy.

<p/>Even though it was merely a jumbled mess of profound energy left in the aftermath of those attacks, it had swept across the frail ground below like a devastating hurricane. In the blink of an eye, the land below had been devastated beyond recognition as several small mountains were directly leveled and a thick layer of gray dust covered the entire area.

<p/>That tremendous and unmatched sword intent smashed against Fen Juechen's chest like a mountain, causing him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to tumble backwards. But he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) immediately halted his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) tumble as a pair of jet-black eyes fiercely glared at Xuanyuan Wentian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hahahaha... hahahahaha...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Xuanyuan Wentian</b></font>)</div><p/>In contrast, Xuanyuan Wentian, who was facing an opponent whose strength had far exceeded his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) own estimation, was not only not flustered, he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) even started to laugh wantonly instead, <div class="bookquote">``This is too wonderful! It is simply too wonderful! I had originally believed that you had come at me because you were being reckless and ignorant, unable to control your own emotions. But to think that you actually had sufficient confidence to face me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tsk... tsk, tsk! Nineteen days!''  (<font color='red'><b>Xuanyuan Wentian</b></font>)</div>Xuanyuan Wentian smiled as he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) gave a sigh, <div class="bookquote">``In the short span of nineteen days, your strength was actually able to increase to this extent... Hahahaha! This is simply far too wonderful! The Devil Lord wasn't lying to me after all... Ah, no! This is even more delightful than what the Devil Lord had described! The past millennia of effort has indeed not gone to waste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Fen Juechen, <div class="bookquote">``???''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is indeed worthy to be called... a power that is on the level of the gods and devils,''  (<font color='red'><b>Xuanyuan Wentian</b></font>)</div>Xuanyuan Wentian said as he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) wild laughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) stared at Fen Juechen, his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) eyes widening as they shone with the most intense greed, elation and madness, <div class="bookquote">``This is truly... the power of devil blood and devil soul that has merged together again after a thousand years!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Fen Juechen's pitch-black eyes widened in shock as he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) gave a low roar, <div class="bookquote">``What did... you say!?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div></body></html>
