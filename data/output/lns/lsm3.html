<p/>The boy yawned, lying against an apple tree in the mansion grounds. To him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), it was just another bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``...Ah, I want some Coke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was the third son of the Iphelleta House, Riley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's becoming more frequent. My dreams of the past.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A world with concrete floors and skyscrapers...
It was a reflection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) past life.
Since the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) unintentionally pulled the holy sword from the ground, there were only battles. To prevent the destruction of the world with the coming of the demon lord, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had to slay countless monsters.

<p/>Instead of being able to attend school with his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had to force his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) way through numerous battles.
He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) sighed as he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) past life from his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) dreams.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It always comes back right when I'm about to forget.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) head, remembering his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) phrase, `I want to have some Coke.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Coke, huh...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) favorite drink back in the `past.'
Sadly, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) did not know how to make it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tsk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`How I long for the burning sensation of the carbonated liquid pouring down my throat, but that's impossible now...'

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) thought to himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) locked his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) fingers and stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there's no need to repeat my past.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I will live this life in peace.'

<p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) memories still intact, that was what he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had thought upon being reincarnated into this world.

<p/>To fight with a blade, to save the world...
To become idolised, to be relied upon...
It was unneeded.
He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) would avoid any obstacles in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) path.
Thankfully, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was now the third son of an important noble family.
Perfect for a lazy and carefree life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``...Young master, young master!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>If only there weren't any obstacles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear lord! Are you sleeping again?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Christ</b></font>)</div>`Christ.'

<p/>Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had just woken up from a nap, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) eyes again to avoid this situation.
It was to appeal for his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) sleep to not be disturbed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is already past noon and the sun is starting to set! How are you supposed to sleep at night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>If a man tries, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can sleep all day.
Almost like a vegetable, although not quite.

<p/>`Being drowsy at day and sleepy at night are two different things.'

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answer in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) snored loudly.
An act to show the butler that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was still in the land of dreams.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Time may have taken much from me, but I can still tell between truth and lies.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have been serving you for almost 20 years. You should stop that act of yours and get up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may have talked like that, but Ian had a way of discerning the truth. At this point, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) was just pleading for Riley to get up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Haah. It is almost dinner time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ian</b></font>)</div><p/>Ian shook Riley's shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ahh, is that so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Riley</b></font>)</div><p/>Riley stood up, unable to resist the sad voice.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) didn't want the old man to cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems...you did not train today, either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Riley</b></font>)</div><p/>Riley did not respond to Ian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you will see your potential, if you would just try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The nagging began.
Again.
Riley began to doubt whether waking up was the right action.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just, what is the reason?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hey, what do you think today's dinner will be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In terms of wisdom, you would easily surpass both of your brothers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ian</b></font>)</div><p/>Ian once evaluated Riley to be `too mature for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) age'.
In a good way.
As a baby, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) acted in a way which did not fit his (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) age, due to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) old memories.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Others may be oblivious, but I know! That young master is...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Riley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``...Lazy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Riley</b></font>)</div><p/>Riley responded with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! Not at all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ian</b></font>)</div><p/>Ian's face was dyed red, with steam coming out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha...honestly! Do you know how angry I was at those bastards in Iffa village!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ian</b></font>)</div><p/>Ian closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) eyes, and pounded his (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) chest in anger, only to realise Riley had already distanced himself from him (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>).
Ian followed, mumbling foul words as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) did.

<p/>***

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Honestly, Lady Iris! Please discipline Master Riley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) still will not even touch the sword... It is as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) is trying to become a wizard.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's so wrong with that, Ian?''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>Within the second dining room of the mansion, there were two...no, three people at the table.
The woman smiled towards her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son who was sitting opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heheh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Riley</b></font>)</div><p/>Riley smiled back at his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) mother when their eyes met.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) mother was the only person in the mansion who would understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>).
Iris.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) would listen attentively at his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) absurd stories about his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) dreams.
A great mother who truly wished for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son's happiness, despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) lack of effort to learn the swordsmanship of the House.
If Riley were to pick his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) greatest treasure, it would undoubtedly be her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Haah. The same goes for you, my lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ian</b></font>)</div><p/>Ian sighed at the two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh? What do you mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Young master is already at the age of 18. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is an adult. How long will you continue to accept his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) childish behaviour? It is time to be a bit more strict with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). And there is also the issue about the successor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ian</b></font>)</div><p/>Ian pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) finger between his (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) eyebrows as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) said those words. Just remembering about it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) a headache.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you not angry? Lady Orelly and both her (<font color='blue'><b>Orelly</b></font>) sons would visit you in their spare time, just to ridicule you. Those rude ingrates.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>TLN: The honorific that the butler uses here specifies that Lady Orelly is the first wife of the Iphelleta family, and the mother of the first and second sons. Lady Iris is the second wife and also Riley's mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ian, watch your language. We are still in the mansion...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I will say it. The two of you...need some ambition. Do you not want to get back at them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ian</b></font>)</div><p/>Ian began his (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) complaint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Instead of talking about that weird dream of yours!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Riley</b></font>)</div><p/>The dream Riley always spoke of to his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) mother. When Ian shouted at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) should be talking about swords instead, Riley replied,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Weird dream you say. But it's still interesting right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Riley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Huh? Yeah it is interesting... Wait, that is not the point!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ian</b></font>)</div><p/>Ian began to appeal to Iris about Riley's good traits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know how smart young master is the most, my lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Riley</b></font>)</div><p/>At a young age, Riley was the fastest at learning how to write and speak.
That was not the only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) could say.
There were countless more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Riley</b></font>)</div><p/>Riley's problem solving skills were beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) age, and whenever danger would approach, he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) would disappear from the mansion, using `hide and seek' as an excuse.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) would only reappear once the danger had passed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am still...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Iris</b></font>)</div><p/>Iris knew perfectly well just how different Riley was from an average person. The dreams, the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) spoke... Each word and action he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) took seemed imbued with maturity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wisdom can be put to use for the sword as well! I have spoken to you before about his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) unprecedented talent...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Iris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Iris</b></font>)</div><p/>Iris cut Ian's words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am happy as long as Riley is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Even so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) was not bothered by Riley's actions.
Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) would only wish for his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) happiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Haaah...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ian</b></font>)</div><p/>Ian's shoulders drooped as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) realised he (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) had failed to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) again.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) felt a little smaller than before, as if all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) muscles underneath had shrunk as well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ian, it's my life, so I'll take care of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Riley</b></font>)</div><p/>Riley snickered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) took a mouthful of soup, knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) escaped Ian's nagging thanks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cough!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Iris</b></font>)</div><p/>Iris suddenly began coughing.
Did her (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) food go down her (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) airway?
Was there too much pepper in the soup?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cough, Cough!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The coughs seemed quite rough.
Riley's face began to darken as the coughs did not stop even after some time had passed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``...Mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Iris</b></font>)</div><p/>Iris covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) mouth with one hand, while shook the other to tell she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) was okay.
But Riley noticed something on her (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) shaking hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, your hand...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cough! Cough!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) expression changed for the worse when she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) hands.
Red.
Blood soaked her (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) hands and dripped down onto the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother!!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Riley</b></font>)</div><p/>Riley stood anxiously, but quickly turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) head when he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) noticed someone was watching. At that moment, his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) eyes changed to that of a predator's, but quickly returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Huhu...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Riley</b></font>)</div><p/>The laugh was quite distant, but Riley could hear it, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) saw it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please wait, I will bring a doctor immediately!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``...''

 (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div><p/>Leaving only a laugh of ridicule, the first wife of the Finn Iphelleta family faded into the distance.
