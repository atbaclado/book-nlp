The Finn Iphelleta House had its third son delivered.
His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) black hair had a striking resemblance to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother's.
His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) name is Riley.
<div class="bookquote">``At least I have enough strength left to name him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Iris</b></font>)</div>Lady Iris smiled brightly.

<p/>Age 0
The child spoke.
It was a word other than <div class="bookquote">``Mommy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mumbled, <div class="bookquote">``Finally...''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>What did he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mean?
We never taught him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) that word...

<p/>Age 1
I have secretly inspected young master's body.
To check his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) talent.
...
I have never seen anyone with such talent in my 60 years.
My head was filled with excitement and envy.
Not as a butler, but as a swordsman.
Was it because I'd seen talent that surpasses genius?
I could not fall asleep that night.

<p/>Age 2.
The first-born, Master Ryan, has won second place in the Novice Swordsmanship Tournament.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Novice</b></font>) competitors were all around the age of 14--15.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Novice</b></font>) defeated them at the age of 9.
The maids of the mansion are clamoring that he (<font color='blue'><b>Novice</b></font>) may surpass his (<font color='blue'><b>Novice</b></font>) father.
Fools, the true 'genius' is here.

<p/>Age 3.
Even if their mothers are different.
Watching his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) brothers train everyday should arouse some curiosity.
But the young master shows no interest in the sword.
Simply watching this talent go undeveloped, is driving me insane.

<p/>Age 4.
Maybe I'm getting impatient due to my age.
I have given him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) a wooden sword.
Unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) usual intelligent self, for some unknown reason, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) bawled his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) eyes out, screaming because he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) did not want to hold the sword.
In the end, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) never even swung it once.
Was I too early?

<p/>Age 5.
The Finn Iphelleta House has a bloodline that has been blessed by the sword.
After the first son, the second-born, Master Lloyd, has done well in the Novice Tournament.
As I carefully mention the idea to the Young Master Riley, he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) replied with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``Not doing it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Age 6.
Hah... Just why?

<p/>Age 7.
Master Ryan has already learnt to imbue mana into the blade.
Within the mana was a pure and powerful essence. Therefore, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ryan</b></font>) father gave Master Ryan the title of <div class="bookquote">``Geuk-Geom'' (<font color='red'><b>Master Ryan/Ryan</b></font>)</div>.
Master Riley showed no reaction to the story.
Hah, if only he (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) would just hold a sword.
TLN: Geuk-Geom = Strong Blade

<p/>Age 9.
I am disheartened.
I am sure there will be great achievements.
Even if I ignore my bias as his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) servant.
Even if I ignore his (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) talent for the sword.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Riley</b></font>) is a truly intelligent boy, and it crushes me.
...
Today, Master Lloyd was given the title of <div class="bookquote">``Sok-Geom''
 (<font color='red'><b>Master Lloyd</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) speed was extraordinary, even beyond Master Stein's.
Suddenly...
<div class="bookquote">``Did I see it wrong?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>This thought occurred to me.
TLN: Sok-Geom = Quick Blade

<p/>Age 10.
Master Stein finally made a decision.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) suggested that the young master competes in the Novice Tournament.
...
On that day, Master Riley disappeared from the mansion.
Everyone in the mansion searched for him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>).
One day, two days, one week.
In the end, when the competitors of the tournament were decided, the young master showed himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hide and seek is fun! Isn't that right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) smiled brightly.
Everyone in the mansion laughed nervously.
<div class="bookquote">``My eyes weren't wrong.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>That's what I believed.

<p/>Age 11.
He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) naps in the apple tree in the gardens. Eats his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) meals.
Reads a few books and goes to sleep.
That's his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) daily routine.
Sleeping 12 hours a day. Never touching a sword.
Even Master Stein has given up on Master Riley.

<p/>Age 12.
For fuck's sake!
Why won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) hold a sword?

<p/>Age 13.
Master Riley's laziness has reached the pinnacle of laziness.
Even Master Stein has had it and went to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) a beating.
Yet Master Riley had disappeared miraculously.
Master Stein could not even find him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>).
Wow...

<p/>Age 14.
One day, I decided to complain to the young master.
<div class="bookquote">``Why won't you learn swordsmanship?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Was he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sleeptalking?
He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) replied to my question,
<div class="bookquote">``I managed to kill the demon lord, so I can take it easy right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>I couldn't understand his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) answer, and sighed.

<p/>Age 15.
Master Riley may be lazy, but there are times when things change.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) talks with his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) mother.
The book I read was so interesting.
I had a strange dream.
Lady Iris always replied with a smile.
Always mentioning that his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) happiness is the most important to her (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>).

<p/>Age 16.
It's been a long time since all members of the Finn Iphelleta House were gathered together.
Master Stein.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) two wives.
The 3 sons.
After dinner, Master Stein made an announcement,
<div class="bookquote">``I should start deciding on the successor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Master Stein</b></font>)</div>Master Riley was never mentioned in the discussion.

<p/>Age 17.
For the first time in my life, I have seen Master Riley seething with rage.
Someone who wouldn't bat an eye for countless insults towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>).
It was when his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) mother was ridiculed by the other sons because of Master Riley, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) was declared ineligible as a successor candidate.
In that short moment, I saw the potential in his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) eyes.
Master Stein also saw it.

<p/>Age 18.
During her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) meal, Lady Iris collapsed after coughing blood.
As the table turned red with blood, Master Riley's face changed dramatically.

<p/>And today.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) raised a sword...
