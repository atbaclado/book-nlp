<p/>TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE
CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) BIRTH

<p/>Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons
it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will
assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns,
great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on
a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as
it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of
the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is
prefixed to the head of this chapter.

<p/>For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and
trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable
doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which
case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never
have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of
pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the
most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the
literature of any age or country.

<p/>Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a
workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance
that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this
particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could
by possibility have occurred.  The fact is, that there was considerable
difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of
respiration,--a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered
necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) lay gasping on a
little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and
the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter.  Now,
if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful
grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of
profound wisdom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would most inevitably and indubitably have been
killed in no time.  There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old
woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer;
and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and
Nature fought out the point between them.  The result was, that, after
a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise
to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been
imposed  upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could
reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been
possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer
space of time than three minutes and a quarter.

<p/>As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron
bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly
from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words,
`Let me see the child, and die.'

<p/>The surgeon had been sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) face turned towards the fire:
giving the palms of his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) hands a warm and a rub alternately.  As the
young woman spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) rose, and advancing to the bed's head, said, with
more kindness than might have been expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>):

<p/>`Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.'

<p/>`Lor bless her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dear heart, no!' interposed the nurse, hastily
depositing in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.

<p/>`Lor bless her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dear heart, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has lived as long as I have, sir,
and had thirteen children of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own, and all on 'em dead except two,
and them in the wurkus with me, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll know better than to take on in
that way, bless her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dear heart!  Think what it is to be a mother,
there's a dear young lamb do.'

<p/>Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother's prospects failed
in producing its due effect.  The patient shook her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head, and stretched
out her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand towards the child.

<p/>The surgeon deposited it in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms.  She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) imprinted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cold white
lips passionately on its forehead; passed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face;
gazed wildly round; shuddered; fell back--and died. They chafed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
breast, hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever.  They
talked of hope and comfort. They had been strangers too long.

<p/>`It's all over, Mrs. Thingummy!' said the surgeon at last.

<p/>`Ah, poor dear, so it is!' said the nurse, picking up the cork of the
green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) stooped to
take up the child.  `Poor dear!'

<p/>`You needn't mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,' said
the surgeon, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) gloves with great deliberation. `It's very
likely it _will_ be troublesome. Give it a little gruel if it is.'  He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>)
put on his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) way to the door,
added, `She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was a good-looking girl, too; where did she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) come from?'

<p/>`She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was brought here last night,' replied the old woman, `by the
overseer's order.  She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was found lying in the street.  She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had walked
some distance, for her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) shoes were worn to pieces; but where she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) came
from, or where she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was going to, nobody knows.'

<p/>The surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand.  `The old
story,' he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) head: `no wedding-ring, I see. Ah!
Good-night!'

<p/>The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once
more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair
before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.

<p/>What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist
was!  Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) only
covering, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it
would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) proper station in society.  But now that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was enveloped in the
old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was
badged and ticketed, and fell into his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) place at once--a parish
child--the orphan of a workhouse--the humble, half-starved drudge--to
be cuffed and buffeted through the world--despised by all, and pitied
by none.

<p/>Oliver cried lustily. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could have known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was an orphan,
left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
would have cried the louder.
